If Algolia suddenly breaks, reimport this configuration file in its UI!

How:
1. Go here https://www.algolia.com/apps/XNXFGO6BQ1/explorer/configuration/documentation/searchable-attributes

  Or, if that doesn't work:
  - Open algolia.com
  - Navigate to Search (sidebar)
  - Navigate to App: Streamlit docs > index: documentation

2. Open "Manage index" dropdown, choose "Import Configuration"

3. Pick the index_config.json file that's in this folder.

DONE!
